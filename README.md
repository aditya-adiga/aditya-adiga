**AI Safety Researcher | Computer Vision & Medical Imaging Background**

Hello! I'm Aditya. My primary research focuses on **AI Alignment**, **Human-AI Interaction**, **Epistemic Tools**, and **context-flexible risks** in AI systems. I also have a strong technical background in **Computer Vision**, **Computational Pathology**, and **Medical Imaging**.

## 🔭 Current Research

### 🧩 MOSSAIC
**Substrate-sensitive approaches to AI risk mitigation**

Exploring how AI risks and failure modes change across computational substrates, architectures, and deployment contexts. I am developing frameworks that treat substrate sensitivity as a first-class concern, proposing families of mitigation strategies rather than universal solutions.

### 🧵 Live Conversational Threads
**Epistemic tools for collective sensemaking in AI safety research**

Investigating how AI systems can support collective sensemaking without displacing human judgment. I am designing and developing an epistemic interface that backgrounds AI while preserving context, structure, and interpretive agency, using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to maintain thematic relationships.
