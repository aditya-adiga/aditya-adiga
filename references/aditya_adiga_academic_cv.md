### MOSSAIC -Substrate-sensitive approaches to AI risk mitigation

Collaborators: Matthew Farr (Groundless AI), Sahil (Groundless AI)

- Conducting research on substrate-flexible risks in AI systems, focusing on failure modes and safety concerns that manifest differently across distinct computational substrates , architectures, and deployment contexts.
- Investigating limitations of single-solution safety interventions when applied across heterogeneous substrates.
- Developing frameworks that capitalise on AI capabilities to generate substrate-sensitive mitigation strategies , proposing a family of safety interventions rather than a uniform solution.
- Contributing to the theoretical grounding and conceptual clarification of substrate flexibility as a core concern in AI safety research .

### Live Conversational Threads -Epistemic tools for collective sensemaking in AI safety research Collaborator: Sahil (Groundless AI)

- Proposed and developed an epistemic tool for collective sensemaking , emphasising human-centred AI interfaces that background AI to facilitate genuine human interaction and discernment.
- Designed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of conversational threads to capture contextual and thematic relationships , enabling non-disruptive navigation.
- Implemented features for bookmarking and 'potential insight' marking , enhancing collaborative sensemaking and discovery of novel theoretical constructs.
- Enabled AI-driven formalism generation from marked insights in conversations, personalised to user-defined research interests (e.g., Mechanistic Interpretability, Model Evaluations, Developmental Interpretability).
- Contributed philosophical analysis on AI interfaces enabling meaningful human participation in increasingly AI-integrated research environments.

### Tumour Microenvironment Segmentation in Whole Slide Images

- Developed a UNET++-based segmentation model to identify tumours, stroma, and surrounding tissue in WSIs, achieving approximately 80% IoU .
- Addressed challenges arising from heterogeneous pathological microenvironments with substantial tissue variability.
- Collaborated closely with a pathologist to annotate underrepresented regions and iteratively refine model performance.

### Instance Segmentation of Tumour-Inflicting Lymphocytes

- Fine-tuned Detectron2-based instance segmentation models to identify tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within inflamed stroma regions.
- Integrated the segmented output of the earlier project, focusing on refining the model's ability to detect lymphocytes effectively within the context of the tumour microenvironment.
- Validated segmentation results with domain experts to ensure relevance for immunotherapy analysis .
